Chris began his studies on the horn aged 11 when he earned a place at the Junior Royal College of Music. Though French Horn was his principal study he also learned Composition and Piano. In 2003, he won the Merton Young musician of the Year.  Three years later he became Principal Horn of the London Schools Symphony Orchestra and soon after that was offered a place in the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain. In his final year at the Junior Royal College of Music, Chris was awarded the Anthony Gray Horn prize.

Now in his final year at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, Christopher recently won the BBCSSO concerto prize and performed the Hindemith Horn concerto with the orchestra. He has quickly gained prominence in the Scottish freelance scene after winning a trail for Principal Horn in the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, and now works regularly with many of the leading Scottish ensembles.

Chris also enjoys composition and has written pieces for various ensembles which are published by such companies as Warwick Music and Edition db. In June 2013, ‘Durham scenes,’ was premièred by the Northern Lights Wind quintet, of which Chris is a member, as part of their residency at the St. Magnus international music festival in Orkney.
