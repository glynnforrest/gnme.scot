A graduate of the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris and the University of Glasgow, Stuart Harris-Logan retired from performance in 2009 having danced for a number of Europe’s most prestigious ballet and contemporary dance companies.  His MPhil thesis, Nuair a bha Gaidhlig aig na h-Eoin, explored the role of mimesis as a method of encoding non-literary information in performance, using bird imitation in Scots Gaelic oral culture as a case study.  His present interests include the role of mimetic dance, gesture and masque in central and west African cultures.

Stuart Harris-Logan is Archivist for the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, a Trustee of the Thomas Wilson Trust and the Founder and Chair of the Conservatoires’ UK Archives Forum.
