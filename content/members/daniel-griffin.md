Daniel Griffin is a young emerging double bassist from Stirling, Scotland. He began his higher education at Stevenson College where he studied piano for two years while having private double bass lessons from Tom Berry of Scottish Opera. From there he went on to study double bass with Iain Crawford, Principal Bass of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra (BBC SSO) , at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland (RCS) where he achieved his Bachelor of Music with Honors in the First Class. From Autumn 2015-Spring 2016 Daniel continued his studies with Timothy Cobb, Principal Bass of the New York Philharmonic, at the Manhattan School of Music in New York City. His studies in the US would not have been possible without the help of the Dewar Arts Award, the Stirlingshire Educational Trust Fund, the Hope Scott Trust and the Waddel Memorial Prize.

He has participated in many masterclasses from world renowned teachers such as Jannes Saksala, Thomas Martin, Rinat Ibragamov and Joel Quarrington. Daniel has played with many ensembles including the BBC SSO, Scottish Opera and Edinburgh Youth Orchestra (EYO).
In March 2014 Daniel travelled to India with the BBC SSO on tour as part of a mentoring project that he successfully auditioned in at the RCS. The trip was a once in a lifetime experience which involved travelling to 3 Indian cities to give music workshops as well as public concerts, with Nicola Benedetti as soloist and James McMillian as conductor.

Through EYO he was given the special opportunity to play alongside the National Youth Orchestra of Iraq in a collaborative project involving the two orchestras. It was an experience he wonâ€™t forget as it let him appreciate the determination that people have to play music even when they live in a dangerous country.

Daniel is currently working as a freelance musician in the UK.
