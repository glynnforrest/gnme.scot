Under the artistic leadership of composer Richard Greer and conductor Jessica Cottis, the Glasgow New Music Expedition (GNME) is a group of brilliant young instrumentalists from Scotland, fiercely committed to performing new music by Scottish composers.

We are an ensemble flexible in instrumentation, made from a twelve-piece 'core' orchestra. Our purpose is to commission, perform and create new work primarily from young, Scottish-based or Scottish-trained composers and to take this new work to the people of Scotland and beyond. We support composers at all stages in their development and especially look to the nurturing of new and young talent.

Our repertoire consists entirely of new work.

Our collaborators include the Glasgow School of Art, Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, the University of Glasgow, Glasgow Life, and the Scottish Music Centre.

Come and explore with us.
