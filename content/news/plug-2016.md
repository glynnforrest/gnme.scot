The full force of the Glasgow New Music Expedition are invited back to PLUG to premiere another six new works by talented student composers from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. This groundbreaking, 50-world-premieres-a-year-making, trailblazing festival marks its tenth year supporting new work.

GNME presents a fascinating programme of new works influenced by the fictional SCP Foundation, a secret organisation entrusted by global governments to contain and study anomalous entities, locations, and phenomena that defy natural law. Featuring new work from composers Anna Gigoreva, Alex MacKay, Nora Marazaite, Juta Pranulyte, Patrick Shand and Aiden Teplitzky, with the Glasgow New Music Expedition conducted by principal conductor Jessica Cottis.

Join us on a journey of discovery and wild imagination as we navigate our way through the weird and wonderful world of SCP.
