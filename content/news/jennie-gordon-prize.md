We are delighted to announce the creation of the Jennie S. Gordon Memorial Composition Prize for students at The Junior Conservatoire of The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.

Funded by the Jennie S. Gordon Memorial Foundation and curated by The Glasgow New Music Expedition, this new prize seeks to encourage young composers to excel and to encrouage some to pursue a life in music.

On Saturday 21st of March GNME will give workshop performances of shortlisted compositions before a varied panel award the prize of Â£100 for new work.
