From Creative Scotland:

'Over 1200 music industry professionals will gather in Rotterdam from 16 - 19 May 2018 for Classical:NEXT, the world’s biggest contemporary classical showcase and expo.

Held in the De Doelen concert hall complex, the event will showcase new music from all over the world, while the trade fair is essentially a market for products, for music and for ideas. With over ninety trade fair stands, Scotland will be in prime position at Stand 12, led by a team from the Scottish Music Centre and for the first time, will feature an artist delegation, supported by Creative Scotland.

Scottish-based emerging composers and musicians will have the opportunity to highlight their music, build their contacts and network with the classical music sector on a global scale. Artist attending include Jay Capperauld, Richard Greer (Glasgow New Music Expedition), Karen MacIver & Hilary Brooks (Piano Piano), Ailie Robertson and Sean Shibe.

Gill Maxwell, Executive Director of Scottish Music Centre, said: “Scotland has a vibrant contemporary classical scene, a calendar bursting with internationally renowned new music festivals, and creators and artists working in new, exciting, collaborative ways across traditional classical, experimental and improvisation. I’m delighted to be out in Rotterdam next month to promote our wealth of talent to our international colleagues.”

Clare Hewitt, Music Officer at Creative Scotland said: “Creative Scotland is delighted to support this delegation of talented Scottish artists and music creators. Their work shows the diversity of artistic practice being cultivated in Scotland right now, taking Classical to the next level.”

Alongside Scottish Music Centre and Creative Scotland, delegates from several other organisations will also be representing Scotland and connecting with international colleagues, including Cryptic, Delphian Records, Dunedin Consort, Glasgow New Music Expedition, Linn Records, Live Music Now Scotland, Red Note Ensemble, Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and Scottish Ensemble.'
