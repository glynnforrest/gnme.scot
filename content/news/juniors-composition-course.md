The Glasgow New Music Expedition, in partnership with The Royal Junior Conservatoire of Scotland, will jointly deliver the Junior Conservatoire's new composition programme.

The programme provides, for the first time, the opportunity for junior students to select composition as their main area of musical study, and to provide regular access to professional musicians to workshop and perform their work.

Through this academic year we have been hosting workshops to explore percussion and strings, led by GNME members Glynn Forrest and Andrew Huggan. Our work culminates in a public workshop performance of student works on Sunday, May 7th directed by our Principal Conductor, Jessica Cottis, at The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.

We believe in the importance of new music in Scotland. We look forward to developing this partnership and to offering these composers access to opportunities which will profoundly support their development.

Join us on May 7th at 3pm to hear the culmination of our first year working together!
